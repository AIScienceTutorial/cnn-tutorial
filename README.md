# CNN Tutorial

Tutorial materials explaining convolutional neural networks.

The tutorial is currently composed of two notebooks: 

  - `exercise-1_keras.ipynb` explains how to make basic neural networks in Keras
  - `exercise-2_cnn.ipynb` explains how CNNs work, and how to make one with Keras
  
## Using the Notebooks

The notebooks are designed to be easy to use on the cloud or on your own systems.

### Running Locally

The environment needed for the notebook is described in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml)

First, install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) then use Anaconda's command line tool to build the environment:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

### Running on Google Colab

*TBD*
